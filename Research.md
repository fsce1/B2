## AI Research
- What is A.I.?
- What is the history?
- How has it been presented in media before?

A.I. is a very broad subject of computer science, and it has been portrayed in many different ways throughout its conception. 
In 1984, one of the first books to tackle the subject of AI, Neuromancer was released. It explored the possibility of storing people's consciousness in computer storage and being able to create new ones, as well as putting those consciousnesses into robots. It invented the phrase "Matrix" to describe a simulated world that lives inside a computer. This being one of the first pieces of media to be in a Cyberpunk style, it influenced many future films, games, and other pieces of media such as Cyberpunk 2077, The Matrix and Ghost in the Shell.
Another example of an AI character is GLaDOS from the Portal games. She is the AI controller of Aperture Science, a large scientific research facility that the Portal games take place in. She oversees your gameplay, adding context and humour as you complete the game's tests, and by the end of Portal 2, becomes a character you can empathise with and understand.
