# Project Management
I had to plan out every feature I needed to add in order to stay on track and make sure I have enough time to implement every feature. I decided to use a calendar instead of a Trello board which I usually use. I decided to try something different as I didn't like Trello that much. Having a direct link to time is very useful as I can see exactly when I should be working on specific targets.

A very important part of project management in all forms of software development is using Source Control, also known as Version Control. This is the practice, usually through a third-party application, of logging/tracking every change you have made to the source code and assets across development.<br>
There are many different ways to handle version control, for example Git + Github, Unity's Version control, and AWS CodeCommit. They are all fairly similar, however I chose to use Github as it is what I have used in the past and is considered the Industry Standard. <br>
Version control works by logging every change you make to a script, as well as every asset you add to the repository and stores it in a file called a "commit". You can then push that commit to Github's servers, along with a small description of what you have changed, and anyone that has access to that repository can download that commit onto their computer and stay up-to-date.<br>
This was extremely useful for working on multiple machines, as I can sync the computers from the Github cloud anywhere. Version Control also allows you to check out old versions of your repositories, meaning you can roll back changes that are bad, or view previous versions of the repository.
