I had to plan out every feature I needed to add in order to stay on track and make sure I have enough time to implement every feature. I decided to use a calendar instead of a Trello board which I usually use. I decided to try something different as I didn't like Trello that much. Having a direct link to time is very useful as I can see exactly when I should be working on specific targets.
