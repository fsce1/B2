# Overview
Silent-Rush is a Realistic Tactical Shooter in which you play as part of an insurgent group, fighting against the Russian Military in a fictional modern-day civil war.

The game takes place in sessions where you decide an infiltration location, and then retake Forward-Operating Bases (FOBs) by infiltrating the location and clearing it of enemies. There are multiple side-objectives to each infiltration, such as picking up intelligence or freeing prisoners etc.
Once you have completed the objectives that you can, you then proceed to an exfiltration area (on the other side of the map from your spawn).

You play against multiple AI enemies that take defensive positions inside the map, and you have an AI teammate that you can direct to suppress fire, watch your back, or stay back and keep quiet for stealth segments. 
# Controls and Player 
Since the game is intended to be realistic, I want to approximate a real human's capabilities with the player controller. This means mechanics like slow base movement speed, weapon sway and inaccuracy while walking (so you need to stay still to shoot accurate shots), as well as the ability to lean around corners and slow walk for silent/quiet movement. This adds a lot of complexity to the movement, as you need to consider if you are close enough that the enemies can hear you. I aim for the gameplay to be relatively slow and methodical.

# Game Loop
Once you choose a map from the main menu screen, it shows the Infiltration Screen which includes the functionality to select where you are infiltrating from, selection for the gun that you want to bring in, and the current objectives + objective locations. Once you have selected all of that, you can infiltrate. This is where the gameplay itself is, as you spawn in with your teammate and begin attacking the objectives. An entire map will be around 500x500m - 1000x1000m
