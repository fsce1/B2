Before I began creating the game, I came up with multiple ideas and concepts
## Idea 1: Tactical Shooter
- 2-Player co-op
- Simple AI Teammate you can order to open doors, throw flashes, etc.
- Teammate gets out of your way, allowing you to do most of the shooting, covers your flank
- Slow gameplay, clearing rooms and angles
- No ADS, low accuracy when moving
- Tarkov, Ready or Not, CS2
## Idea 2: Movement Shooter
- Wall running, Titanfall-style grappling hooks
- Accurate guns in mid air, large bonus for headshots
- Scored at end of level on bullets used, time, etc.
- No ADS
- Large levels, multiple paths through (secret shortcuts etc.)
## Idea 3: Realistic Sniper Game
- Realistic Zeroing and Bullet physics
- Bipod stabilisation
- Bolt action rifles
