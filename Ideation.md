I knew that I wanted to create a first-person shooter, as it is a great way to experiment with hostile AI and a lot of my favourite games are FPS's. However, FPS is a very broad genre and has many different styles and speeds of gameplay. For example, Escape from Tarkov is a very slow, tactical and realistic shooter with accurate bullet and armour physics, meaning one shot is enough to kill in many circumstances. In comparison, a game like Titanfall 2 is very movement-based and fast-paced, with a long time-to-kill (TTK). Titanfall 2 has advanced movement mechanics such as double-jumping, sliding, wall-running and bunny-hopping which pushes the skill ceiling very high.
## Idea 1: Tactical Shooter
My Initial Idea was to create a Tactical Shooter in the style of Escape from Tarkov and Counter-Strike 2. These games have a very high skill ceiling and play quite slowly, as they have slow movement speed and increased inaccuracy when walking, This 


- 2-Player "co-op"
- Simple AI Teammate you can order to open doors, throw flashes, etc.
- Teammate gets out of your way, allowing you to do most of the shooting, covers your flank
- Slow gameplay, clearing rooms and angles
- Aim-Down-Sights (ADS), low accuracy when moving
- Tarkov, Ready or Not, Counter-Strike 2
## Idea 2: Movement Shooter
- Wall running, Titanfall-style grappling hooks
- Accurate guns in mid air, large bonus for headshots
- Scored at end of level on bullets used, time, etc.
- No ADS
- Large levels, multiple paths through (secret shortcuts etc.)
## Idea 3: Realistic Sniper Game
- Realistic Zeroing and Bullet physics
- Bipod stabilisation
- Bolt action rifles
- Simpler AI, will try to locate you and fire back as well as running to cover if they spot you.
