The game in its current state is playable, which at the very least meets the client brief. On top of that though the game has a lot of depth, with a variety of weapons, spawn locations and assets found within the map. Each gun has its own recoil, magazine size and overall feel. The game is definitely replayable and I could see myself going back to try out different builds and playstyles.

Some areas for improvement would be the games feedback. Visual and audible feedback would help elevate the game ten fold. I think this game would benefit from a damage indicators, gun shot audio and a medical symbol near the HP numbers. This kind of feedback would make the game more responsive and I would feel less cheated out of death. A simple Health logo PNG would suffice and for the other suggestions I'm sure you could look to YouTube or begin experimenting. 
As well as this, there are some areas that you can't shoot through, such as the wire fences and an antenna at the military base

- the pro of the game is that it feels hyper realistic. 
- A con is that some players might find it difficult if they are beginners. 
# Student 3
- Could add some information about what each gun does, currently there are just names with no explanation.
- The jumping is highly inconsistent.
- The map is set up in such a way that there is no reason to pick a weapon other than a sniper rifle.
- There is currently no way to exit the game.

# Student 4
- The shooting mechanics are very accurate.
- The map diagram is very clear and shows the different areas of the map well.
- Players should be able to shoot through the barbed wire walls.
- The jumping is quite overpowered and makes the player travel too fast.

- Reloading whilst scoped keeps you locked into 'zoomed in' movement- limits movement speed and aim- is this intentional? 
Jumping sometimes works, standing still jump is reasonable height (sometimes you have a baby jump). Run and jump is too high- slides to far, is too fast and '#unrealistic' for a simulation/tactical shooter. 
- Game would benefit from crouch and possibly prone. Also an indicator as to where you are being shot from or audio. 
- However, overall, the gunplay is excellent, recoil feels reasonable for the gun (DT MDR). A.I is mainly responsive (increase turn speed and reaction time).
# Student 6
- Indicator of where you are getting shot from around crosshair
- Jumping is broken
# Tommi
- correct names showing in menu
- jumping is not working all the time
- movement speed is slow maybe a speed boost or a closer spawn
- audio would be nice for knowing directions of enemies
- some textures are broken on vehicles Normals are facing wrong direction

# Friend
- add max distance for enemy spotting you
- infil screen needs a lot of work
- add more cover on the map
- add sprint key
- ragdolls should have no collision
- ADS on press not release
- give weapon crosshair a black outline
# Response
I agree with a lot of the feedback on the character movement that was given, especially the jumping issue. As it is too late to go back and fix this, I have just removed jumping for now. It broke the game in many ways and promoted an extremely unrealistic playstyle where you would jump around the map at extreme speeds. I also agree with the need for crouch and prone positions and possibly a sprint feature as these were originally planned but I ran out of time to add them. 

Another large issue was that many people didn't know where they were being shot from, which led to a bit of frustration as they were seemingly getting killed from nowhere. I think the biggest reason why this happened was a lack of audio feedback. I added gunshot sounds to the player and enemy that uses Unity's directional audio. This means that you can better place the direction that the enemy is shooting from as you can hear their gun fire. Another person suggested that there should be a damage indicator (similar to Halo or Fortnite). While this would fix the issue with players not knowing the direction they are being shot from, I don't think I will add this feature as it is quite unrealistic and does not fit the minimal style of the HUD that I have decided on. Adding tracers to the enemy bullets and audio to the shots seems to be enough to place where the shots are coming from.

There were also some issues with the map design, which I think exacerbated the issues with players detecting where they were being shot from. The map that I designed, Clifftown, is very open and has many people stationed on roofs and in sniper towers, meaning that many enemies are >100m away and you need the DT MDR with an 8x scope in order to have a fighting chance. Using guns intended for Close-Quarters Combat (CQB) was not a viable tactic at all. If I were to make a second map, I would add much more cover on the ground level and less sniper enemies.

There are also some smaller Quality of Life issues that were brought up, such as the weapon staying "scoped in" while the reload animation was playing, meaning that your sensitivity, movement speed and FOV stayed very low while reloading instead of un-scoping. There were also a few props such as wire fences that you were not able to shoot through even though you should be able to.
