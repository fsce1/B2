The game in its current state is playable, which at the very least meets the client brief. On top of that though the game has a lot of depth, with a variety of weapons, spawn locations and assets found within the map. Each gun has its own recoil, magazine size and overall feel. The game is definitely replayable and I could see myself going back to try out different builds and playstyles.

Some areas for improvement would be the games feedback. Visual and audible feedback would help elevate the game ten fold. I think this game would benefit from a damage indicators, gun shot audio and a medical symbol near the HP numbers. This kind of feedback would make the game more responsive and I would feel less cheated out of death. A simple Health logo PNG would suffice and for the other suggestions I'm sure you could look to YouTube or begin experimenting. 
As well as this, there are some areas that you can't shoot through, such as the wire fences and an antenna at the military base

Anonymous- 
pros-
the pro of the game is that it feels hyper realistic. 

cons-
A con is that some players might find it difficult if they are beginners. 

# Student 3
Could add some information about what each gun does, currently there are just names with no explanation.
The jumping is highly inconsistent.
The map is set up in such a way that there is no reason to pick a weapon other than a sniper rifle.
There is currently no way to exit the game.

The shooting mechanics are very accurate.
The map diagram is very clear and shows the different areas of the map well.
Players should be able to shoot through the barbed wire walls.
The jumping is quite overpowered and makes the player travel too fast.

Reloading whilst scoped keeps you locked into 'zoomed in' movement- limits movement speed and aim- is this intentional? 
Jumping sometimes works, standing still jump is reasonable height (sometimes you have a baby jump). Run and jump is too high- slides to far, is too fast and '#unrealistic' for a simulation/tactical shooter. 
Game would benefit from crouch and possibly prone. Also an indicator as to where you are being shot from or audio. 
However, overall, the gunplay is excellent, recoil feels reasonable for the gun (DT MDR). A.I is mainly responsive (increase turn speed and reaction time).

# Student 6
Indicator of where you are getting shot from around crosshair
Jumping is broken

# Tommi
correct names showing in menu
jumping is not working all the time
movement speed is slow maybe a speed boost or a closer spawn
audio would be nice for knowing directions of enemies
some textures are broken on vehicles Normals are facing wrong direction
