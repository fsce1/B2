# Evaluation
The feedback I got was extremely useful in balancing different aspects of my game, and even though I was not able to get every feature I planned in, I think the game has come out well and is quite fun to play. It has a functional AI system that can handle over 40 enemies in a single map and a smooth feeling character controller with realistic bullet physics and flawless hit detection. I am particularly proud of the weapon sway and movement, including procedural breathing and walking, as well as the enemy AI that feels like it is making tactical decisions.

I think I may have been a bit too ambitious, especially with the AI system. I originally wanted to have a friendly teammate as well as the enemies, however by the time I was finished with the enemy AI, the hand-in date was too close. It required additional logic for the UI, as well as a more complex system that can take orders from the player (to suppress an area, cover your back, etc).
My research into the Impact of AI was extremely useful in creating my own AI, as it taught me many different methods for creating an AI system.

Additional movement options such as sprinting, crouching and going prone would be good to add as well, as it would improve the stealth mechanics and add the ability to snipe people with less weapon sway.
I think the game loop was well thought out and I didn't have to modify the game mode at all.
In my GDD, I explained that there would be different objectives around the map, and I think if I had more time then I would definitely add some simple objectives such as needing to pick up a laptop of intelligence, rescue a prisoner or clear a specific area of enemies.

All Merits
- Research into other games (tarkov?)
- Is difficulty balanced?

Good uses of your English literacy throughout your documentation. It would be nice for you to
further explain your reasons for why you decided to work. Make sure you are justifying your
process.

technical skills are really coming along as you progress through the ports. It is nice to see how
much you have developed throughout.

With your presentation. You did a really good job at presenting to me and the others. It was nice
to see that you were talking to others to get feedback. Your communication skills are really
coming along. However, it be nice to see expansions on your justifications. Continue to work on
your communication, confidence, and creativity skills as these will really help you in your future. I
would recommend that you talk to your team during the group project. Continue to write down
your process. And write down any idea that comes to your mind, No matter how small.

There is an effective number of informing ideas in your documentation. It would be good to have more links throughout and make sure there is a wide range of research techniques used.

Your problem-solving skills are quite clear and sometimes effective, however. There needs to be more ideations and showing more of your concept skills.

You need to link in your Research into your technical skills to achieve the higher criteria. There is some clear evidence of your technical ability here, however. Make sure you are documenting your entire process throughout.

There is an effective amount of professional practice in your documentation and in your pitch, ensure that you are always updating your time plan and are testing your animation with others.

You have some clear communication throughout; however, your documentation needs further work in the form of your page layout and structure. I would encourage you to review your testing results and go back over your work.
