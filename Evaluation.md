The feedback I got was extremely useful in balancing different aspects of my game, and even though I was not able to get every feature I planned in, I think the game has come out well and is quite fun to play. It has a functional AI system that can handle over 40 enemies in a single map and a smooth feeling character controller with realistic bullet physics and flawless hit detection. I am particularly proud of the weapon sway and movement, including procedural breathing and walking, as well as the enemy AI that feels like it is making tactical decisions.

I think I may have been a bit too ambitious, especially with the AI system. I originally wanted to have a friendly teammate as well as the enemies, however by the time I was finished with the enemy AI, the hand-in date was too close. It required additional logic for the UI, as well as a more complex system that can take orders from the player (to suppress an area, cover your back, etc).
My research into the Impact of AI was extremely useful in creating my own AI, as it taught me many different methods for creating an AI system.

Additional movement options such as sprinting, crouching and going prone would be good to add as well, as it would improve the stealth mechanics and add the ability to snipe people with less weapon sway.
I think the game loop was well thought out and I didn't have to modify the game mode at all.
In my GDD, I explained that there would be different objectives around the map, and I think if I had more time then I would definitely add some simple objectives such as needing to pick up a laptop of intelligence, rescue a prisoner or clear a specific area of enemies.
